# HBAviewer SAS4

Monitor LSI / Broadcom SAS Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) directly from Unraid —
temperature, PHY health, attached drives, SMART, the firmware event log, and
**real-time performance graphs** — across **four controller generations**, with
the correct backend auto-detected per card. An optional, opt-in **firmware/BIOS
update** tab is available for users who need it.

> **This is a fork of [FugginOld/Unraid-HBAviewer](https://github.com/FugginOld/Unraid-HBAviewer)**
> that adds **SAS4 / 9600-series** support — the tri-mode cards that run on the
> `mpi3mr` driver and are managed by **StorCLI2** rather than `storcli`.
> Everything else is upstream's work; see [Credits](#credits).
>
> It installs as a **separate plugin**, named *HBAviewer SAS4*, and updates from
> this repository. It is **not** in Community Applications — you install it by
> pasting a URL, and Unraid then checks this repo for updates exactly as it does
> for a CA plugin. See **[Installation](#installation)**.

## Supported hardware

The plugin detects the controller generation and uses the right tool automatically:

| Generation | Chipsets | Cards (examples) | Backend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SAS2** (6 Gb/s) | SAS2004 / 2008 / 2108 / 2116 / 2208 / 2308 | 9207-8i, 9211-8i, IBM M1015, Dell H200/H310 | `lsiutil` (bundled) |
| **SAS3** (12 Gb/s) | SAS3004 / 3008 / 3108 / 3216 / 3224 / 3316 | 9300-8i, 9305-16i, 9361-8i | `storcli` (system-installed) |
| **SAS3.5 / tri-mode** | SAS3408 / 3416 / 3508 / 3516 / 3616 / 3808 / 3816 | 9400-16i, 9400-8i, 9500 series | `storcli` (system-installed) |
| **SAS4 / tri-mode** (24 Gb/s) | SAS4016 / 4024 / 4116 | 9600-16i, 9600-24i, eHBA 9600 series | `storcli2` (system-installed) |

Multiple controllers are shown side by side. Both SAS and SATA drives are supported.

> **SAS3 and later need a Broadcom CLI** installed on the system — proprietary,
> so none of them are bundled here. SAS3 / SAS3.5 use `storcli`; **SAS4 / 9600
> cards use `StorCLI2`, which is a different program rather than a newer version
> of the same one** — the classic `storcli` cannot see a 9600 at all and reports
> zero controllers next to one. The
> **[storcli plugin by dkaser](https://github.com/dkaser/unraid-storcli)**
> (search **"storcli"** in *Community Applications*) ships both. SAS2 cards use
> the bundled `lsiutil` and need nothing extra.

### Known limits on SAS4

Verified against a 9600-24i in eHBA personality. On these cards the kernel
registers no SAS transport class at all, which constrains three things:

- **Locate and the Array Map are unavailable.** Both key on SAS addresses, which
  the card does not publish to the kernel.
- **The Performance tab's link-error series reads as unmeasured**, not zero. That
  poll may only touch instant sources, and the counters are not among them there.
  PHY Health does show them — it can afford to ask the controller.
- **The Event Log needs Broadcom's full StorCLI2.** The Lite build answers that
  command with *"Un-supported command"*, and the tab says so rather than showing
  an empty table that would read like a healthy log.

## Features

- **Overview** — per-controller temperature gauge with a configurable alert
  threshold, plus a real **health rollup** (goes yellow/red on high temp, a
  failed drive, or PHY errors — not just heat). Shows chip, firmware, BIOS,
  driver version, IT/IR mode, connected-drive count, and PCIe info. Pre-P20
  SAS2 firmware is flagged; cards with no onboard sensor show `N/A · no sensor`
  instead of erroring.
- **HBA Health** — five independent indicators (thermal, link integrity,
  topology, host link, controller read) with a **worst-of** rollup and a reason
  string naming the offending PHY. An indicator that cannot be measured reads
  **grey/unknown**, never green — a collector that times out or a card that is
  pulled must not look healthy.
- **PHY Health** — per-PHY link state, negotiated speed, attached SAS address,
  and error counters (invalid DWords, disparity, loss-of-sync, reset) — read
  from the controller (lsiutil) or from Linux `sysfs` (`mpt3sas`) on SAS3/3.5.
  **Set a baseline** per controller and every counter is then shown as a delta
  and an errors/hour rate, so "40,000 invalid DWords two months ago" stops
  looking like "40,000 last night". The baseline lives on `/boot` and survives
  reboots; a reboot or driver reload invalidates it rather than reporting a
  negative delta.
- **Top offenders** — above the PHY table, the PHYs with the highest error rate
  since the baseline, each **named by the drive it serves** (enclosure/slot, or
  `/dev/sdX` on SAS2). PHYs with no baseline are excluded rather than ranked at
  zero — zero would read as "measured and clean" when it means "never measured".
- **Attached Drives** — `/dev` name, **what Unraid calls the disk** (`Parity`,
  `Disk 1`, `Cache`), enclosure/slot, HBA port, model, serial, state, size,
  SAS address, link speed, firmware, and a **per-drive SMART** button. The
  `/dev` name and the Unraid slot appear on the PHY and SMART tables too, so a
  row here can be matched against the Main page without tracking `sdX` by eye.
- **Array Map** — a grid of the physical bays, arranged the way they sit in
  the chassis, so a problem drive is a place you can walk to rather than a slot
  number. You place each drive once — drag it into its bay, or click the drive
  then the bay — and the layout is saved to `/boot`; **lock it** when you are
  done so a stray click cannot undo it. **Copy map** puts the layout on your
  clipboard so it can live somewhere other than the flash drive, **Restore map**
  rebuilds it from that text, and **Undo** covers a mistaken Clear or resize. Colour is the signal: bays stay neutral until something needs
  attention, a temperature bar makes a hot row visible without reading every
  number, empty bays are drawn as empty bays, and a disk being rebuilt into
  parity shows as such. Nothing on the machine knows your chassis layout — on a
  direct-attach backplane the enclosure/slot addressing is invented by the
  controller — so this is the one thing the plugin cannot work out for you.
- **Locate a drive** — blink one drive's **activity light** from the Drives
  table or a bay on the Array Map, so a row becomes a bay you can walk to. Needs no
  SES, no enclosure processor and no GPIO — it works by reading the drive twice
  a second, so anything with a tray light can be found, including plain HBAs on
  dumb backplanes. Stops itself after five minutes so a forgotten blink cannot
  keep a disk awake indefinitely.
- **SMART tab** — health, temperature, grown defects, pending sectors, and
  power-on hours for every drive, collected **in the background** so it never
  blocks the UI and (on SAS) **never spins up a standby drive**. The collection
  is **kept until you press Refresh** rather than expiring on a timer — reading
  every drive takes ~1 s each and the numbers change over weeks — and every
  screen that shows it states how old it is.
- **Event Log** — the firmware event log, **archived to `/boot`** so history
  survives reboots and firmware ring-buffer wrap, with copy-to-clipboard for
  support tickets.
- **Enclosure / topology** — an enclosure summary per controller (direct-attach
  vs expander/backplane).
- **Dashboard tile** — at-a-glance temperature and health on the Unraid
  dashboard (Unraid 7.2+).
- **Notifications** *(opt-in, off by default)* — sends one Unraid notification
  each time a controller's health status **changes**, and never repeats while it
  stays the same. Delivery follows your existing Unraid notification settings.
- **Diagnostic bundle** — one button collects the raw `storcli`/`lsiutil`
  output, the sysfs state and the plugin's own parsed JSON into a single archive
  for a bug report. **Anonymised by default** with one length-preserving map for
  the whole bundle, so serials, WWNs, SAS addresses and the hostname are
  replaced while models, sizes, firmware versions, temperatures and error
  counters stay real. Your flash GUID, licence key and share names are never
  collected at all.
- **Export / API** — a read-only JSON snapshot of every controller
  (`/plugins/hbaviewer/export.php`) plus the same data in Prometheus text format
  (`?format=prometheus`), for Homepage-style widgets and dashboards. Both are
  **session-gated**, so an unauthenticated Prometheus scraper cannot poll them —
  see [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md#export--api).
- **Performance graphs** *(real-time, in-browser)* — live per-controller
  throughput, IOPS, %util, latency, PHY error-rate, and temperature, sampled
  ~2 s from `/proc/diskstats` and `sysfs` (zero-dependency — no sampler daemon,
  no flash writes; history lives in the browser and resets on reload).
- **Firmware / BIOS Update** *(advanced, opt-in, off by default)* — an assisted
  flash page that detects the card + running firmware, runs a read-only
  per-controller sanity check, takes your model-correct image, and flashes one
  controller behind hard guardrails with a live log. See the safety section below.

All *monitoring* data is read directly from the HBA (`storcli` / `lsiutil`),
Linux `sysfs`, and `smartctl` — no agents, no polling daemons, no external calls.

## Firmware / BIOS updates (advanced, opt-in)

> **⚠ Flashing HBA firmware can permanently brick your controller.** This
> feature is **off by default** and is for users who already know how to flash
> an LSI/Broadcom HBA from a console. If you are not sure, do not enable it.

HBAviewer is otherwise strictly read-only. The optional **Firmware/BIOS Update**
tab is *assisted, not automatic*: it detects the card and runs the tools, but
**you** supply the model-correct firmware image and (if not already installed)
the flash tool.

**Enabling it:** Settings → *Advanced — Firmware Flashing* → tick
**Enable firmware/BIOS flashing** → Save. A red **Firmware/BIOS Update** button
then appears at the bottom of that same Settings page, and is the only way in —
the Monitor does not link to it. Reaching the one screen that writes to hardware
means coming back past the warning that explains what it costs to get wrong.

**How a flash works, per controller:**

1. **Verify** — a read-only listing **scoped to that one controller** (`storcli /cN show`
   or `sasNflash -c N -list`) confirms the tool sees the exact card you're about to flash.
2. **Upload** — the exact firmware `.bin`/`.rom` for *your* model (optionally a
   BIOS `.rom`, and the `sas2flash`/`sas3flash` binary if it isn't in `PATH`).
3. **Confirm & flash** — tick the acknowledgement, type `FLASH`, and flash. A
   live log streams; on success it prompts you to **reboot**.

**Tools used** (auto-detected in `PATH`, or upload them — none are bundled):

| Generation | Chip | Flash tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SAS2 (9200/9211/2308) | `SAS2xxx` | `sas2flash` |
| SAS3 (9300/9305) | `SAS30xx`/`SAS31xx` | `sas3flash` |
| SAS3.5 / 9400 tri-mode | `SAS34xx`/`SAS35xx` | `storcli /cN download` |

**Guardrails (all enforced server-side, not just in the browser):**

- Opt-in toggle gates the whole feature (default off).
- The Unraid **array must be STOPPED** — the flash is refused otherwise.
- Read-only verify first, **scoped to the single target controller**, so you flash
  the card you actually confirmed — not another HBA in the box.
- Explicit acknowledgement checkbox **and** a typed `FLASH` confirmation.
- Single-flight lock — one flash at a time, never auto-retried.
- Uploaded filenames are sanitised and confined to a fixed working directory.

**Caveats — read these:**

- **Bricking is a real, unavoidable risk** if the image doesn't match the card.
  Double-check the model/chip against the image before you flash.
- The flash tools are **proprietary** and per-generation — not shipped with the
  plugin. Install them (e.g. via a storcli/flash plugin) or upload them.
- Some SAS2 cards need a specific `sas2flash` build (e.g. a 9207-8i wants the P14
  tool). Use the right one; the plugin won't second-guess it.
- storcli 94xx flashing semantics vary by firmware package (a downrev may need
  `noverchk`); the log is shown verbatim — treat it as best-effort.
- Linux flashers **update** the BIOS region but **cannot erase** it.
- Stop any Unassigned Devices on the HBA as well before flashing.

## Documentation

| Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| **[HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md)** | Task-oriented guide — install, first run, finding the drive behind a failing PHY, mapping your drive bays, baselines, the export endpoint, generating a bug-report bundle, and troubleshooting. |
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** | How the plugin is built — backend selection, the parse layer, request lifecycle, caching, the mutating paths, and the test strategy. Read this before changing code. |
| `source/.../CONTEXT.md` | Module vocabulary — the short definitions the code assumes you already know. |

## Requirements

- Unraid 6.12 or newer (7.2+ for the dashboard tile)
- A supported LSI / Broadcom SAS controller (see the table above)
- For **SAS3 / SAS3.5** cards: `storcli` installed
- For **SAS4 / 9600** cards: `StorCLI2` installed — a different program from
  `storcli`, not a newer one
- `smartctl` (ships with Unraid) for the SMART features
- The `lsiutil` binary for SAS2 cards is bundled in the `.txz` — nothing extra
  is downloaded

## Installation

This plugin is **not in Community Applications**, so it installs from a URL.
Unraid treats a URL-installed plugin exactly like any other afterwards: the
Plugins page shows updates from this repository, and **Update** applies them.

### 1. Install the plugin

In the Unraid web UI, go to **Plugins → Install Plugin**, paste this URL, and
click **Install**:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techanonymous/Unraid-HBAviewer-sas4/main/hbaviewer.plg
```

Or from a terminal:

```bash
plugin install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techanonymous/Unraid-HBAviewer-sas4/main/hbaviewer.plg
```

> **If you already have the original HBAviewer installed, remove it first.**
> Both plugins install to the same directories, so they cannot coexist — the
> second one to be installed wins and the other's entry stops working. Your
> settings, drive-bay map and event archives live in
> `/boot/config/plugins/hbaviewer/` and are **not** removed by uninstalling, so
> switching over keeps them.

### 2. Install the Broadcom CLI your card needs

Nothing further is needed for a **SAS2** card — skip to step 3.

**SAS3 / SAS3.5 (`storcli`) and SAS4 / 9600 (`StorCLI2`)**: search **"storcli"**
in *Community Applications* and install
**[dkaser's storcli plugin](https://github.com/dkaser/unraid-storcli)**. It ships
both tools and puts them on `PATH`, which is all this plugin needs — it probes
for whichever one can actually read your card rather than guessing from the name.

That covers every tab on a 9600 **except the firmware Event Log**, because the
StorCLI2 build it ships is the feature-reduced *Lite* one. If you want the Event
Log too, install Broadcom's full StorCLI2 as well:

1. Download **StorCLI2** from Broadcom (proprietary, so it cannot be redistributed
   here — and it cannot be fetched automatically either: the page is
   JavaScript-driven behind bot protection with no stable direct URL).
2. Copy the `.zip` onto the server — any share will do — then run the helper the
   plugin ships, **on the server**, not on your desktop:

    ```bash
    bash /usr/local/emhttp/plugins/hbaviewer/scripts/install_storcli2.sh /path/to/StorCLI2.zip
    ```

   It unpacks the archive (it also accepts the `.deb`, `.rpm` or a bare binary),
   checks what it found really is StorCLI2, copies it to
   `/boot/config/plugins/hbaviewer/tools/` so it survives a reboot, and adds three
   lines to `/boot/config/go` that restore it at boot — `/opt` is RAM here and the
   flash is FAT32, so it cannot keep the execute bit. It backs `go` up first, is
   safe to re-run, and takes `--no-go` if you would rather do that part yourself.

**Settings → HBA Connection → Firmware Event Log** shows these same steps and
whether the full build is currently installed, so you never have to come back here.

### 3. Confirm it found your card

Open **User Utilities → HBAviewer SAS4**. The settings page opens instantly and
names the detected **Access Method** — `StorCLI2`, `storcli` or
`lsiutil (bundled)` — along with the controller it found. Check that before
opening the Monitor: if it reports a card but says the tool is NOT INSTALLED, go
back to step 2.

Then find the monitor under **Tools → HBAviewer SAS4 → HBA Monitor**.

### Updating

The Plugins page checks this repository and offers updates like any other
plugin. From a terminal, `plugin check hbaviewer.plg` then
`plugin update hbaviewer.plg` does the same. (GitHub caches raw files for a few
minutes, so a release published moments ago may need one extra check.)

## Layout

```text
Tools
└── HBAviewer SAS4
    └── HBA Monitor   (tabs: Overview · HBA Health · PHY Health · Drives
                              · Array Map · SMART · Event Log · Performance)

User Utilities

└── HBAviewer SAS4 Firmware (Firmware/BIOS Update*)
                             *opt-in, off by default; the page and its menu entry
                              only exist once it is enabled

Dashboard
└── HBA Temperature tile (Unraid 7.2+)
```

## Configuration

Open **User Utilities → HBAviewer SAS4**. The settings page opens instantly and
shows the detected **Access Method** (`StorCLI2`, `storcli` or `lsiutil`) so you
can confirm the right backend is in use before opening the Monitor.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access Method | (auto) | Read-only. Shows which backend is in use — `StorCLI2` (SAS4), `storcli` (SAS3/3.5) or `lsiutil` (SAS2) — and warns if a card is found but the tool it needs isn't installed. |
| lsiutil Port | 1 | *SAS2 only* — lsiutil port number. Only shown if SAS2 cards are detected. SAS3/storcli cards are enumerated automatically. |
| Alert Threshold | 80 °C | The badge turns red (ALERT) at or above this temperature. |
| Show PCIe Info | On | PCIe width/speed row in the Overview. |
| Show PHY Health | On | PHY tab. |
| Show Attached Drives | On | Drives tab. |
| Show Event Log | On | Event Log tab. |
| Show Performance | On | Performance tab — real-time throughput / IOPS / %util / latency / PHY-error-rate / temperature graphs (in-browser, resets on reload). |
| Enable notifications | **Off** | Sends an Unraid notification when a controller's health status changes (checked every 10 minutes). One notification per change, never a repeat while it persists. |
| Enable firmware/BIOS flashing | **Off** | *Advanced.* Unlocks the Firmware/BIOS Update page and the button that reaches it. Read the [firmware section](#firmware--bios-updates-advanced-opt-in) before enabling — flashing can brick a card. |

The **drive bay map** deliberately has no row on this page. Its grid size and
its lock live with the map itself (the **Array Map** tab), because a layout is
something you build while looking at it, not a number you set on one page and
go check on another. They are still persisted the same way everything else here
is.

Save your settings, then click **Open HBAviewer Monitor**. The Monitor page opens
immediately with a **"Loading HBA information"** banner and reads the hardware in
the background — the first read can take up to a minute on slow controllers, and
the page fills in automatically when it's ready (no blank hang, no timeout).

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FugginOld/Unraid-HBAviewer.git
cd Unraid-HBAviewer

# Fetch the lsiutil binary and build the .txz (see build.sh for details)
bash build.sh

# build.sh prints the MD5 and version to update in hbaviewer.plg
```

The bundled `hbaviewer.x86_64` is the original `lsiutil` v1.70 compiled for Linux
x86-64. `storcli` is **not** bundled — SAS3/3.5 cards use the copy installed on
your system. `build.sh` also fetches **Chart.js** (the Performance tab's charting
library, MIT) into the plugin dir; like the `lsiutil` binary it isn't committed
to the repo. The Performance tab degrades gracefully with a message if it's absent.

## Testing

The shell parsers and PHP helpers have a golden-file test suite that needs no
hardware:

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
```

It runs the parser goldens plus the PHP unit tests (using a local `php`, or the
`php:8.2-cli` Docker image if `php` isn't installed), and needs GNU awk.

CI additionally syntax-checks every language the plugin ships — `php -l`,
`bash -n`, `node --check` — and runs ShellCheck, PHPStan and actionlint on top.

Fixtures are **real controller output wherever possible** — captured with the
`scripts/capture*.sh` helpers or contributed by reporters on the issue tracker,
with identifiers masked length-preservingly so column alignment (which the
parsers key on) survives. A fixture that was modelled by hand rather than
captured has caused a real bug here before, so treat fixtures as evidence
rather than as editable test data.
