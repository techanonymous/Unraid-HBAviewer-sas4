   both are archived to the same per-controller file. A box that changes backend
   (a SAS2 system where the user later installs storcli) therefore accumulates
   both shapes, and a renderer built for one shape hits undefined keys on the
   other. These two helpers let the caller show only what it can format. */

   with its own command set, but everything it hands the renderers was written to

   It lives in this file rather than view.php because event_archive.php is
   required before any renderer runs AND is require-able on its own by the test
   runner, so both callers share one copy instead of keeping two in step.
