Anonymised: $([ "$ANON" = 1 ] && echo yes || echo "NO — this bundle contains real serials, WWNs and SAS addresses")
SMART included: $([ "$SMART" = 1 ] && echo yes || echo no)

01-environment  kernel, Unraid + plugin version, tool presence, driver, proc_name
02-raw          raw storcli / lsiutil / lsblk output, one file per command
03-sysfs        scsi_host, sas_phy, sas_device, sas_expander, sas_end_device and controller PCIe state
04-parsed       what each composer made of the above, plus hbaviewer.cfg
05-smart        smartctl -n standby -a per drive (only if requested)

Read 02-raw and 04-parsed together. Every issue this project has closed was
diagnosed by comparing the raw tool output against what the parser made of it.

Nothing from /boot/config is included except the plugin's own hbaviewer.cfg.
No flash GUID, licence key, ident.cfg, super.dat, shadow, network config or
share names is collected, under either setting.
