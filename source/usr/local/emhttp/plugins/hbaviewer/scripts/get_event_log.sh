# StorCLI2 / SAS4. Two differences from the classic path, both measured:
#   - The ring must be BOUNDED. An unbounded `show events` on a 9600-24i returns
#     62k lines / 1.2 MB and takes 3.6s — the whole log since the board was
#     manufactured. `type=latest=<n>` is the documented bounded form; the archive
#     in /boot is what provides history, so a page read does not need all of it.
#   - Broadcom's *Lite* build has no `show events` at all. It answers
#     "Un-supported command", and there is no substitute: eventloginfo, termlog
#     and get events are all rejected too, and `show alilog` (the one that
#     succeeds) is a config dump with no event ring in it. Say so plainly rather
#     than rendering an empty table that reads like a healthy log.
