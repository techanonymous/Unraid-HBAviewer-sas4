# arithmetic, the five indicators, and the rollup — this script never persists
# anything, never computes a rate, never decides a state.
#   storcli: temp/fw/drives from the same light `show` + `show temperature`

#            counters from sysfs (the driver exposes these regardless of
#            backend — same fields get_phy_health.sh's _build_phy_sysfs reads).
#   lsiutil: temp/fw + current link width/speed from the IOC + banner queries
#            get_hba_info.sh already uses. lsiutil has no max_link_width query,
#            but the KERNEL does regardless of backend, so the maximum comes
#            from the same sysfs read the storcli path uses, reached through
#            the scsi_host instead of a storcli-reported PCI address (#14).
#            Drive count comes from sysfs (_drive_count) — lsiutil itself is

# a single drive's queue/, holders/, slaves/, power/ and partition subdirs.
# Enclosure/SES targets carry no `block/` and are still skipped. Issue #11
# fixed this returning a hardcoded 0; issue #14 fixed the glob that replaced
