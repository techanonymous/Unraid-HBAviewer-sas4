# Self-asserting check for get_attached_drives.sh's drv_lsiutil() sysfs stages
# -- Stage 2's SAS-address/PHY join and Stage 3's fallback -- the SAS-transport
# depth bug from issue #14. Neither stage had a test before this plan: reading
# the wrong sysfs class (sas_end_device instead of sas_device) and the
# fixed-depth target glob were both invisible to the suite until a reporter
# hit them on a real SAS9207-8i.
#
# drv_lsiutil is lifted out with sed rather than sourced: the script calls
# hba_each at load and would go looking for real hardware. lib.sh IS sourced —
# it only defines functions — so the personality filter under test is the real
# hba_is_sas_proc rather than a copy that could drift from it; require_binary and
# hba_query are then stubbed over so no lsiutil binary is needed.
